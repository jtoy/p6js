# p6js
My experiments with working on a next generation visual coding environment


# features
* tweak colors, just click wherever you see fill and a color picker will pop up
* underscore javascript library included and can be used instantly

# features / experiments to be worked on
* realtime documentation browser
* live coding
* tweak shapes mode

# TODOS
* save (for when autosave is not being used)
* clojurescript integration
* multiple window support
* dont allow multiple run windows?
* console for sketch


how should the coordinate system act?
what does fullscreen really mean?

#built on 
uses many open source libraries like electron and ace editor
